                <p class="text-justify">The purpose of education is not to revolve around acquisition of a pre-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one’s full potential &amp; the ability to use those skills for the greater good. The famous American educator John Dewey states “Education is not a preparation for life, but is life itself.” Therefore the seeds of social change are sown in the imaginative brilliance of a child’s mind. It is our earnest endeavor to provide a nurturing environment to allow the latent potential &amp; goodness of a child to blossom.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">As the purpose of education is the overall development of a child so as to make them the future leaders. By becoming leaders they will achieve the zenith of success. And thus making India super power &amp; being called “sone ki chidiya” once again. These students will one day become engineers, doctors, IT professionals &amp; thus we will contribute in the progress of nation. We shall produce such leaders by cultivating in them consciousness which pave way for social upliftment &amp; instills sense of responsibility towards their nation with a sound knowledge in the context of a globalized world.</p>
